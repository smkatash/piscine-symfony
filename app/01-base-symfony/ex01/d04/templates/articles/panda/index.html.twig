            <p style="text-align:center;">Giant panda typically inhabit regions that are high in elevation, 
            between 4,000 and 11,500 feet, which they share with other rare animals such as the Sichuan takin. 
            Pandas prefer living in damp, misty forested areas.
            Giant pandas have specific needs and they include having at least two species of bamboo and a water source contained 
            within an old-growth conifer forest. This type of forest offers large tree stumps and hollow logs that are the right 
            size for panda dens. The other benefits to this type of habitat are that shelter and nutrients are present for 
            the bamboo that grows there. </p>

            <p style="text-align:center;">The giant panda was once widespread throughout China, and even Myanmar and northern Vietnam. 
            However, they have been on the endangered species list from 1990 to 2016, before this was switched to vulnerable â€“ 
            mainly due to habitat loss, poaching and poor breeding. </p>
