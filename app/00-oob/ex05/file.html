    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</li>
        <li>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <ol>
        <li>It has survived not only five centuries,</li>
        <li>but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</li>
      </ol>
